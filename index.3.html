<title>Importance of recycling</title>

<p>As can be seen below, nearly all respondants regard recycling as either important or very important. The big question now, is why they are not taking
action. I believe that the answer to this question is relatively simple. After conducting the survey, it became clear that most people are either not aware 
of e-waste recycling programs or consider the recycling process as being too expensive.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem would be to have th government make recycling facilities more accessible to all citizens. Though this may be a pricy 
investment, the cost of not recycling e-waste will be much greater in years to come.</p>
