<title>Recycling e-waste</title>
<p><font face="Arial narrow" size="5">E-waste is a very recent problem and very few people are aware how to treat it. I conducted an investication to see how many people recycle
	on a regular basis and the results are quite shocking. It turns out that 42% of the respondants rarely recycle and nearly 15% do not recycle
	at all!</font></p>
